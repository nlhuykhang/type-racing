		how to have many players on the same race??

7/7
	got to come back ha?
	so where was I last time??
	need something like a mediator, no controller is more suitable
	controller need to know when there is a new comer, and give it a id?

	ok it's not really hard right :),
	but I still feel uneasy to code, actually this makes sense cause I haven't coded node for a long time
	still need little more time to get used to it again

	ok where am i
	strategy for communication is quite ok now
	problem now is how to restart the socket connection to have an 'init' event whenever users start a new race?

8/7
	ok where am I??
	basically everything seems ok now almost finish 
	wait the backend seems finished already
