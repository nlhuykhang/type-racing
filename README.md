<h2>Typer Race</h2>

A side project of mine to practice Nodejs with SocketIO<br>

This site pretends users as racers. Every five users participate will form a race of five racers, they will type to find as first as they can to become the winner<br>

Mongodb is required in case you want to become a racer. Otherwise, you still can play after I up host this site somewhere. Will be soon, just too busy these days<br>
